# PHP Form

Created a simple PHP Form for a university assignment, using PHP and MySQL.

The web application allows a user to:

1. Select a course title via a drop-down/pop-up list or selection menu;
2. Select a time at which that particular course is offered via a separate drop-down/pop-up list or selection menu;
3. Enter their name via a text field;
4. Enter their phone/mobile number via a second text field (in case the course is cancelled at short notice and participants need to be notified);
5. Submit a booking request by pressing a `Submit' button, after selecting/entering the data above.
